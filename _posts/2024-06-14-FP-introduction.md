# Functional Programming

All books about functional programming start with a great poem that is so vivid and enlightened that 
I for the other hand will start in another way. I will make a case that 1000x programers do not need functional programming,
furthermore, programmers that do not need functional programming do not need object oriented paradim either, heck take structed programming of the view too. Give them all the true power of a computer with GO/TO statements, direct memory assigments, if you are one of those brillian people that can computer at a level that a current computer does, than you do not need this book. This book is for developers that are lazy, low on resources, time and one to get work right the first time always. 
Structured Programming, Functional Programming, Object Oriented programming. 

Functional programming came into my one day and I have never been the same. Its like all of the sudden all my decisions where easy to make, and I persued one thing ever since, understanding functional programming.
I've been coding for over a decade, and I am from the lucky few that can do functional programming for a living.


## AI 

By the time I write this https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-will-become-mathematicians-co-pilot/
I can pretty much guarantee that everything out there has something about AI, this but is no different. 
Even math is getting tha contagious stuff. I think developers are finally getting promoted to not implement details, but to rather write test.... wait what?. To prove my point I will go back to the Terence Tao interview and how the like of an averge Mathematacial like of Andrew Wiles back in 1986. 

I want to live in the life of a Math professional. Imagine you are motivated by the fame and want to takle on of the millenium problems, but these a lot of work to do. Like anything done previously in history, you would like to divide and conquer 

I believe the problem that functional programmers face is the dificulty to create implementations that map their types, or even worse starting at blank screen. AI can help you get some momentum 


I believe that theres no more excuse regarding so thats why I propose you the reader, and me also, in navigating the world of functional programming, but not just with one lense but rather several lenses at a time. People new to functional programming.
